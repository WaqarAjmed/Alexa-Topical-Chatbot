# Overview: 
The project "Design and Development of Topical Chatbot" aims to create a specialized conversational AI focused on specific subjects. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, this chatbot will provide accurate and informative responses within its domain, enhancing user engagement and knowledge. The dataset used is the Topical Chat dataset from Amazon, containing over 8,000 conversations and 184,000 messages with diverse sentiments. The project comprises several stages, including preprocessing, training using deep learning frameworks, evaluation using both objective and subjective metrics, testing, and further improvements.

# Project Details
Overview of the Problem and Potential Application Areas
A topical chatbot is a specialized AI designed for conversations about a specific subject, such as medicine or finance. It can find applications in various domains, including customer support, virtual assistance, e-learning, healthcare, and content generation. However, these chatbots may face challenges when dealing with topics beyond their training.
# Brief Literature Review
A literature review highlighted the following articles (from 2022-2023) on chatbot development:
"Conversational AI with Transformer Models": Discusses Transformer-based models for conversational AI.
"Improving Chatbot Accuracy with Reinforcement Learning": Explores the use of reinforcement learning for chatbot fine-tuning.
"Multimodal Chatbots for Enhanced User Interaction": Introduces multimodal chatbots that combine text and visual inputs.
"Ethical Considerations in Chatbot Development": Focuses on the ethical aspects of chatbot development, emphasizing transparency and accountability.

# Model Used
The project employs a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with the main components:
Encoder: Handles input sequences (questions) and produces encoder outputs.
Decoder: Generates responses based on encoder outputs.
Embedding Layers: Convert input words into numerical vectors.
Dense Layer: The output layer for predicting the next word in the response sequence.

# Parameters:
Encoder and Decoder LSTM units: 512
Embedding dimension: 100
Batch size: 32
Training epochs: 10

# Dataset Used
The Topical Chat dataset from Amazon consists of 8,000 conversations and 184,000 messages. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Key statistics include vocabulary size, maximum sequence lengths, and data division.

# Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning includes optimizing learning rate, LSTM units, embedding dimension, batch size, and training epochs for better model performance.
Results and Evaluations
Performance metrics for the chatbot include response accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, user satisfaction, engagement, completion rate, fallback rate, churn rate, human handoff rate, sentiment analysis, and task completion rate. Good results include accurate responses and user satisfaction, while challenges include understanding out-of-vocabulary words and ambiguous questions.
Example Conversations:
Good Result: Accurate weather information.
Challenging Result: Handling questions about the meaning of life.

# How to Further Improve the Results
Improvements can be achieved through data expansion, fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, integrating multimodal capabilities, addressing ethical considerations, enhancing emotion and context modeling, continuous user testing, and sentiment analysis.
In conclusion, the project showcases the potential of specialized conversational AI. While promising results have been achieved, ongoing research and improvements will shape the future of human-computer interaction.
